## Asking Questions <a name="questions">

If you are struggling with something and can't seem to find a solution to a
problem, **ask questions!**.  There are plenty of people out there that can help you.
Don't feel bad about being confused; it happens to the best of us, and failure is key
part of learning.  Just remember, to try to learn **why** your solution didn't work, not just
what the solution is.
