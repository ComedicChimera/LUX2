## What is a Data Type? <a name="types">

In SyClone, all data has a type.  This type simply specifies what kind of
data, for example, an integer, a character, or a decimal.  SyClone employs
what is called a **unified type system**.  This means that almost all various
sizes of a specific data are condensed into one (the most common size).
The only value to break from this trend are integers as you'll see later on.

## Printing to the Console <a name="console">

Sometimes it is necessary to view to value of item or result of a function call.
To do this, you can **print** its values to the console.  This is done with the
`println` function.

The example syntax for displaying a value to the console would be:
``` syclone
println(1);

println(3.14);
```

Place the value you want display between the parentheses.
